# AI-Driven Enterprise Delivery & Workforce Intelligence Platform

> Transform raw engineering activity into actionable business intelligence for predictable delivery, optimized resource allocation, and data-driven decision-making.

## Overview

An end-to-end AI-powered platform that bridges the gap between low-level technical signals (commits, tasks, tickets) and high-level business metrics (delivery health, cost efficiency, productivity, workforce utilization). Built for engineering leaders, product managers, HR, finance teams, and executives.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. **Knowledge Graph Engine**
- **Dynamic Dependency Mapping**: Automatically builds and maintains a real-time knowledge graph from GitHub commit history, Jira tickets, and task relationships
- **3D Visualization**: Interactive 3D knowledge graph showing code dependencies, contributor networks, and project hierarchies
- **Conflict Detection**: Identifies potential merge conflicts, dependency bottlenecks, and collaboration friction points
- **Team Network Analysis**: Maps who works with whom, expertise clusters, and communication patterns

### 2. **Smart Resource Allocation & Simulation**
- **AI-Powered Task Assignment**: GenAI suggests optimal resource allocation based on:
  - Employee skills and tech stack proficiency
  - Current workload and availability
  - Historical performance and velocity
  - Budget and timeline constraints
  - Knowledge graph insights (who knows what code)
  
- **Interactive Hierarchical Graph Expansion**: After initial team allocation, watch the knowledge graph expand in real-time:
  - **Root Node**: High-level feature/epic from Smart Allocate
  - **First Expansion**: LLM breaks feature into sub-tasks based on complexity
  - **Node-by-Node Assignment**: At each graph node:
    - Another LLM call analyzes task requirements
    - Assigns specific team member based on role, expertise, and graph position
    - Generates detailed Jira ticket with acceptance criteria
    - Creates dependencies between related nodes
  - **Visual Simulation**: Watch graph grow as tasks spawn sub-tasks, tickets get assigned, and dependencies link
  - **Automatic Jira Creation**: Each node produces a ready-to-publish Jira ticket with proper hierarchy (Epic → Story → Sub-task)

- **Simulation Features**:
  - Visualize team expansion at each project node
  - See real-time task breakdown and assignment flow
  - Predict bottlenecks and critical path dependencies
  - Test "what-if" scenarios for budget/timeline changes
  - Review complete work breakdown structure before committing

- **Dynamic Reallocation**: Daily progress analysis triggers automatic recommendations:
  - Detect delays early and suggest additional resources
  - Identify over-staffed areas for cost optimization
  - Balance workload across team members
  - Adjust based on CapEx/OpEx constraints

### 3. **Delay Prediction & Risk Mitigation**
- **Predictive Analytics**: ML models forecast project delays based on:
  - Commit velocity vs. sprint goals
  - Task completion rates and complexity trends
  - Team capacity and historical burn-down patterns
  - Dependency chain analysis
  
- **Proactive Alerts**: Early warning system for delivery risks
- **Automated Interventions**: Suggests resource reallocation, scope adjustments, or timeline revisions

### 4. **Meeting Intelligence & Auto-Ticketing**
- **AI Meeting Bot**: Attends meetings, transcribes conversations, and retains full context
- **Automatic Jira Creation**: Extracts action items from meeting transcripts and creates Jira tickets with:
  - Proper assignment based on expertise
  - Realistic effort estimates
  - Linked dependencies and acceptance criteria
  
- **Manager Review Interface**: Track auto-generated tickets, approve/edit before publishing
- **Memory Layer**: Maintains conversation history for continuous context across meetings

### 5. **Voice-Enabled Conversational Assistant**
- **Natural Language Queries**: Ask questions in English or regional languages (powered by Sarvam AI)
  - "How many tickets did John complete this sprint?"
  - "Show me commits for feature X"
  - "What's our current burn rate?"
  
- **JIRA & GitHub Integration**: Fetches real-time data without context switching
- **Voice-to-Voice**: Speak your query, get spoken responses with data visualizations

### 6. **Financial Intelligence (CapEx/OpEx Tracking)**
- **Sprint-Level Cost Analysis**: Track capital and operational expenses for each sprint:
  - Developer hourly rates × time spent
  - Infrastructure costs
  - Tool licensing and third-party services
  
- **Budget vs. Actual**: Real-time comparison of planned vs. actual spend
- **ROI Calculation**: Measure engineering investment returns per feature/project
- **Financial Forecasting**: Predict future costs based on current trajectory

### 7. **HR Performance Analytics**
- **Automated Performance Reports**: End-of-project stats for each employee:
  - Code contribution metrics (commits, lines of code, PR reviews)
  - Task completion rate and velocity
  - Budget impact (cost per feature delivered)
  - Collaboration score (PR reviews, pair programming)
  - Technical impact (dependencies created, bugs introduced/fixed)
  
- **Appraisal Readiness**: AI-generated performance summaries for review cycles
- **Promotion Recommendations**: Identify high performers and skill gaps
- **Retention Risk Analysis**: Predict flight risk based on workload stress, engagement patterns

### 8. **Role-Based Dashboards**

#### **Project Manager View**
- Real-time project health dashboard
- Resource allocation simulator
- Delay prediction with mitigation suggestions
- Budget tracking and financial ROI
- Meeting transcript and auto-ticketing interface
